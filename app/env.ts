  DESC: "What is Tanghulu? It’s a traditional Northern Chinese snack made of skewered fresh fruit dipped into a simple sugar syrup that hardens quickly, creating a solid shell. Back to the Song Dynasty (960–1279), Legend says that when the emperor’s favorite concubine fell sick, a doctor suggested she eat hawthorn fruits fried in brown sugar every day for a fortnight. On her recovery, the doctor became famous and the snack found a permanent place on China’s streets.",
